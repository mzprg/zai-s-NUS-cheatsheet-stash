# zai's NUS stash

hi. i'm [m. zaidan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mzaidanbsani/), a compsci student in NUS.
currently i'm a y1 student (enrolled 23/24)

not an outstanding student (not straight As!!!), but here are my notes anyways
saw a few seniors put theirs online, and i was extremely grateful, so here goes nothing

i also made a module planner on google sheets, which may be helpful if you need it. there's one for CS students, and a more general one as well. you can find it [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1K3Uwi-M5q3lUXoWpmeIonP6WZ_Nedx9rc3auVxN--cQ/edit?usp=sharing).

my module reviews are also in the file ```modreviews.md``` if you need some info for the courses, might be helpful i guess.



| code       |                        |                                 |
|----------|-------------------------|----------------------------------|
| CS1101S  | Programming Methodology | Cheatsheet for midterms & finals |
| CS1231S  | Discrete Mathematics    | Cheatsheet for midterms & finals |
| MA1521   | Calculus for Computing  |  Cheatsheet for finals, personal notes |

**note:**

i did not get A for every mod, which clearly means that there might be errors in some of the cheatsheets here LOL. however, everyone knows that the cheatsheet does not make you automatically get an A anyways, so uh, use at your own risk
