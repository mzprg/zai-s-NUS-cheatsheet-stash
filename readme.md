# zai's NUS stash

hi. i'm [m. zaidan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mzaidanbsani/), a compsci student in NUS.
currently i'm a y1 student

not an outstanding student (not straight As!!!), but here are my notes anyways
saw a few seniors put theirs online, and i was extremely grateful, so here goes nothing

**note:**

i did not get A for every mod, which clearly means that there might be errors in some of the cheatsheets here LOL. however, everyone knows that the cheatsheet does not make you automatically get an A anyways, so uh, use at your own risk
